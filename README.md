Abstract:
Quantum computing is cutting edge technology and at the forefront of progress. With its inception
in the 20th century, the appearance of the first quantum computers provides a glimmer of hope for
the development of quantum computing. Today, quantum software and algorithms are far ahead of
hardware development, yet this has never been a problem for theorists to develop their work. In
quantum programming, the development of programs is complex because it is done with circuits and,
in addition, it is often very unintuitive. This is why more and more testing tools are required to make it
easier to find errors. One of the most useful testing tools is testing with mutants, introducing a mutant
in the code and subjecting it to methods to see if we are able to detect the mutant. In this line work,
for example, metamorphic testing and mutant testing. In this work the objective will be to introduce
the reader to quantum computation, starting from certain mathematical notions and the postulates of
quantum mechanics in a very simple way, to later apply them in quantum qubit systems. Afterwards,
quantum computation will be deepened with circuits and algorithms, giving an understanding of how
they work. Once an introduction to testing and mutant testing is given, it will culminate with the
creation of classes and functions in Python for the quantum programming language Qiskit to be able
to generate quantum mutants for any circuit. This created code will lead to a systematic way to create
mutants for use in quantum testing with Qiskit
